# Rocket League Mapmaking Website Documentation

- Guide by Mr Swaggles
- Site design by ghostrider-05
- Webdev trickery by wejrox

## Deployment

**NOTE**: These steps will currently only work for the main `rocketleaguemapmaking.com` domain, as it hasn't been made
customisable yet. If you wish to view this locally, see the [contribution](./docs/more/contribute.md) documentation.

This site can be executed as a docker container on the host machine.

1. [Install Docker-CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on the host machine. Docker (non-ce) should also work but is not tested.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Build image not on host with `docker build . -t rocketleaguemapmaking/rlmm:<VERSION>`
4. Push to dockerhub with `docker login; docker push rocketleaguemapmaking/rlmm:<VERSION>`
5. Navigate into the root of the repository on the host.
6. Execute `sh deployment/update_and_deploy.sh <BUILD_VERSION>`, e.g. `sh deployment/update_and_deploy.sh 0.1.0` on host
    - This container will run in the background, and you can access the website.
    - To view all docker containers, execute `docker ps -a`, which are ordered by age.
    - To view the NGINX logs of a container, execute `docker logs <container_name>`.
    - To stop the service, execute `docker stop rlmm`
7. Access the site at the correct URL (`rocketleaguemapmaking.com`).

Read the [contribution](./CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation for guidelines when contributing.

## Certificate Renewal

Currently we [manually redeploy](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewing-certificates) certificates using certbot on the host machine. This should be automated in future.  

1. Stop the docker container to free up port 80 `docker stop rlmm`
2. Execute `sudo  certbot certonly --force-renew --cert-name rocketleaguemapmaking.com` on the host machine.
3. Select option 2 (temporary webserver, hence needing step 1)
4. Check that the new certificate looks good `sudo certbot certificates`
5. Restart the docker container `sudo docker container restart rlmm`
