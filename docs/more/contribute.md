### Edit Existing Content

To edit an existing page, click the link in the footer: `Edit this page on GitHub`. By clicking on this link github will create a fork based on the main branch. Follow all instructions in the section [Add new content](./contribute.md#add-new-content) to make sure your changes are accepted.

### Suggest New Content

Requests may be as simple as "add a section about a special mode", or "add a page about a specific kismet node". We'll do our best to fulfill all requests, as long as they're reasonable. Github discussions can also be used for more general questions and/or suggestions.

1. Make sure that you've looked at the [existing issues](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapmaking/RL-docs/issues), [FAQ](../faq.md/), [future content](../../more/roadmap.md#upcoming-content), and [bounty board](./contribute.md#this-guide) before making a request. It might already exist!
2. Make a request; [create a new issue.](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapmaking/RL-docs/issues) and select a template.
3. Title it appropriately, and let us know exactly what you mean inside the issue description.

### Add New Content

Contribution should be performed through a number of simple steps:

1. Find an issue to fix.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Create a branch for your issue.
4. Make the necessary changes to the repository.
5. Commit and publish your changes.
6. Create a pull request into the main repository from your fork.
7. Address any comments.
8. Branch will hopefully be accepted and merged.

:::warning Guidelines
We have some minor style requirements for documentation additions:

- Always proofread your submissions. PRs that contain spelling mistakes or incorrect grammar will be denied.
- When naming your readme files and folders, use [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for file naming conventions.
- If you are changing / adding content related to UDK, check your changes in UDK (only follow the content you have written and not your own knowledge). Any PR with changes in UDK should be reviewed.
- If you are adding image resources:
  - pay attention to their file size: images above 1MB will not be accepted, and anything above 500KB should be reviewed.
  - Images should be added in `/docs/.vuepress/public/images` and icons in `/docs/.vuepress/public/icons`
- Create an issue for small contributions (such as fixing typo's or broken links)

:::details Development and local testing
The project utilizes `vuepress` in order to create pages for our documentation, running on a Node backend.
Tips and tricks on how to style a page can be found [here](../assets.md)

### Dependencies

1. Install [Node v10+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (or later).

- `node --version` should show at least `v10.15.3`. Lower versions have not been tested but may also work.
- `npm --version` should show at least `6.9.0`. Lower versions have not been tested but may also work.

2. Clone the repository to your machine.
3. Execute `npm install` from the root of the repository.

### Execution

1. Execute `npm run docs:dev`.
2. Open the URL specified within the output of the command.

### Components

Vuepress makes use of [Vue components](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/using-vue.html#using-components). If you make multiple components for one page or the components are about the same subject, add them in a folder.

- Components are placed inside `/docs/.vuepress/components/`
- Components are registered globally in `/docs/.vuepress/public/enhanceApp.js`.

**Make sure a custom componentâ€™s name either contains a hyphen or is in PascalCase. Otherwise it will be treated as an inline element and wrapped inside a `<p>` tag, which will lead to hydration mismatch because `<p>` does not allow block elements to be placed inside it.** Read more about it [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html#Component-Names).

Example: `MyComponent.vue` can be called with `<MyComponent/>`\
or `<MyComponent></MyComponent>`
