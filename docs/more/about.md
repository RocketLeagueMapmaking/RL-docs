# About

## New Guide; Who Dis?

First off, a sincere thanks to all of you for using this guide in its various forms over the years. I originally made it with the intent to make a series of guides, but ended up disappearing for a few years. But here we are, almost 4 years after the original release, and at last it is taking its final form thanks to the dedicated efforts of **ghostrider-05** and **JimJoms.**

- Mr. Swaggles

### Bio - Mr. Swaggles

Who am I? I have a few names, depending on where you find me: Mr. Swaggles in Rocket League, Dasoccerguy in DMs or other places, and Dr. Swaggles for smurfing/testing. I have used Blender since 2003, though only for hobby-level projects. I consider myself very competent with Blender, but I am by no means a professional and still have much to learn. I have been playing Rocket League since one week after release, and I can safely say that it is my favorite game ever. Most often you’ll find me shooting some Hoops.
