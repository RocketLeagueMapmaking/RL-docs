# Mapmaking events

## Contests

Map making contests are events that are usually longer in duration. They challenge map makers to add a certain twist or style to the map.
At the end of the contest, the community and a jury will vote on the submissions to arrange the prizes. A map can win at most a few prizes to divide the prize pool over the submissions. You can submit your map by publishing it during the contest on the Steam workshop or another map website and share it (in the Discord server) to make it known you've made a contest map!

See here some events that were held.
