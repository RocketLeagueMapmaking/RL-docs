After rumors following the leaked plans for Rocket League that Rocket League will be transitioned to UE5, Devin acknowledged on Reddit that this is an ongoing project for Psyonix.

What the effects are for Rocket League map making are not clear until Psyonix shares their plans. You don't need to learn UE5 now for map making as it will take some time before they finish this long-term project.
