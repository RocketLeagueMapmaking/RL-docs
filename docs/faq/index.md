:::details How do I get started?

Pick your favorite Getting Started guide (selfishly I would recommend my own: the website you are currently visiting). At the very least, you’ll need [UDK](../resources/downloads.md#setup), [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.com), and a lot of free time. Be sure to join the Mapmaking Discord (top of the [Modding network](../resources/modding_network.md)) and don’t be afraid to ask questions!

:::details What is UDK?

UDK is the development tool for game creation using Unreal Engine 3. It was originally released by Epic Games in 2006, and they continued supporting and improving it until the release of Unreal Engine 4 in 2014. Rocket League was made with this tool, so we have the privilege of using it as well.

:::details How do I test my maps?

The fastest way to test your map is by using [the .bat script](../essential/project_setup.md#batch-script-for-quickly-testing-maps-bsfqtm) from the beginning of this guide to overwrite `Labs_Utopia_P.upk` with your map. If you used the [RLMM UDK RL setup script](../essential/installing.md#rocketleaguemapmaking-udk-rl-setup-script) this script will be located in `{UDK Folder}\UDKGame\Content\Maps\`. Drag your map onto the script, open the Utopia Retro map in Rocket League, and you are ready to go! You can read more about it [here](../guide/udk/map_test.md). To test your maps in multiplayer (recommended if you make use of Kismet and want the map to have multiplayer) you can check out [this corner of the website.](../guide/multiplayer/multiplayer.md#testing-multiplayer)

:::details How do I upload to the Steam Workshop?

Although Psyonix has released their [own Workshop Uploader tool](../guide/multiplayer/publishing.md#psyonix-uploader-tool), we do not recommend using it (unless you are magical). SteamCMD is a more dependable choice to [upload a custom map to the Steam Workshop](../guide/multiplayer/publishing.md). Before uploading your map you will need to make a preview image (or multiple). The preview image will be displayed on [the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/252950/workshop/), and Steam players can also see this image under `Play > Custom Games > Workshop` in the game.

:::details How do I play custom maps with friends?

If you play on PC (either on Steam or Epic Games) you can go the [playing maps](../guide/multiplayer/playing.md) page which explains everything on how to play custom maps online with friends. Custom maps currently are not supported on consoles.
