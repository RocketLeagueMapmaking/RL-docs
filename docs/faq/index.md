## General

:::details How do I get started?

Pick your favorite Getting Started guide (selfishly I would recommend my own, at the top of the [Guides list](../guide/guides)). At the very least, you’ll need UDK, [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.com), and a lot of free time. Be sure to join the Mapmaking Discord (top of the [Communities list](../resources/modding_network)) and don’t be afraid to ask questions!

:::details What is UDK?

UDK is the development tool for game creation using Unreal Engine 3. It was originally released by Epic Games in 2006, and they continued supporting and improving it until the release of Unreal Engine 4 in 2014. Rocket League was made with this tool, so we have the privilege of using it as well.
