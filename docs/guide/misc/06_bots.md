## Psyonix Bots

To spawn bots in a map, the [Kismet node `Add bot`](../kismet/04_tagame.md) may be used. For now they only go to the location of the ball and after that they drive around in circles.

## RLBot

### Standard Fields

To run bots made by the wonderful people of RLBot on your custom map, you can replace your custom map with an existing map (for example [Utopia_P](../../essential/05_project_setup.md#batch-script-for-quickly-testing-maps-bsfqtm)) and start a match on this map in the RLBot GUI (for more information on how to run matches you can visit [the RLBot wiki](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki)).

:::warning Custom fields
As the bots are programmed to run on standard fields, it's only possible to run those bots on custom maps with a standard geometry. If you want to be able to run the bots on custom fields, you can [contact](../../resources/modding_network.md) a bot programmer or [make your own bot](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki). There are multiple tutorials and example bots to get you started.
