# Boost

## List of Terms

What a sad place the world would be without boost. Luckily, it can be added and thoroughly customized. As is tradition, I will start with a list of terms:

* `Boost Pad` - A glowing pad on the ground that gives you a little bit of boost
* `Boost Pill` - A hovering orb that gives you full boost (corner/mid boosts)
* `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` - An actor which controls the logic of the boost pickup
* `FXActor_Boost_TA` - An actor which gives the visual appearance of the boost pickup
* `StaticMeshActor` - The solid object underneath the orange glow
* `Archetype` - A preconfigured asset

The image shown above is a `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` on top of an `FXActor_Boost_TA` and a `StaticMeshActor`. This one is a Boost Pill, as you can tell from the long legs on the model.

## Boost Archetypes

Depending on which version of the Park_P dummy assets you are using, you may not have the `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` archetypes available. **Expand the Archetypes subfolder and look for VehiclePickup.** Inside this folder should be two archetypes named **VehiclePickup_BoostPill**and**VehiclePickup_BoostPad.**

![](/images/udk/advanced/boost_pickuparchetypes.png "Arche-typical setup")

If these are not available, look instead inside **HoopsStadium_P.Archetypes.VehiclePickup** and use them instead.

Next, look inside **Park_P.pickup_boost** for similar archetypes named **BoostPill_FXActor** and **BoostPad_FXActor.**

![](/images/udk/advanced/boost_fxactorarchetypes.png "This season on FX...")

Again, if these are not available for some reason, look instead in **HoopsStadium_P.pickup_boost.**

These archetypes are fully configured and are ready to be placed into the map. They have materials, animations, sound effects, and most importantly, will give you the right amount of boost.

Boost pickups on a standard Soccar map are at these locations. The ± symbol means that there is a pad at both +X and -X, or +Y and -Y, so placing the pickups listed below and mirroring them will make a complete set. Note that the `VehiclePickup` actors are at **different heights** for boost pads and pills. All `FXActor`s are at 0 Z:

![Field with boosts placed as in standard maps](/images/udk/advanced/boost_half_field.png "A heart in a box (see it?)")

| Pickup Type | X     | Y     | Pickup Z |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Pill        | ±3072 | ±4096 | ±72      |
| Pill        | ±3584 | 0     | ±72      |
| Pad         | ±1792 | ±4184 | ±60      |
| Pad         | ±940  | ±3308 | ±60      |
| Pad         | ±1788 | ±2300 | ±60      |
| Pad         | ±2048 | ±1036 | ±60      |
| Pad         | ±3584 | ±2484 | ±60      |
| Pad         | 0     | ±4240 | ±60      |
| Pad         | 0     | ±2816 | ±60      |
| Pad         | 0     | ±1024 | ±60      |
| Pad         | ±1024 | 0     | ±60      |

Luckily, boost pickups behave better when mirroring than spawnpoints do. To create the symmetrical pickups, **select the stack of objects, copy and paste them, right click, and select Transform > Mirror X/Y Axis.**

:::warning
**Whenever you copy and paste a set of boost objects, the new `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` will not have the FXActor assigned automatically. You must go in and manually reassociate them.**
:::

## Associating VehiclePickups and FXActors

If you tested your map immediately after adding these archetypes, you were probably disappointed because the boost stays visible after you pick it up. This is because **each `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` must be manually associated with each `FXActor_Boost_TA`.** Sorry.

The most efficient way to do this for all boost pickups is with the Scene tab of the Content Browser.

![](/images/udk/advanced/boost_associate.png "This will click eventually")

**Double click each `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` object. This will transport the camera to it in the 3D viewer. Click the FXActor beneath the pickup. Then click the green arrow in the FXActor slot in the properties subwindow.**

:::warning
**Make sure you have literally anything other than the Park_P or HoopsStadium_P boost FXActor archetype selected in the Content Browser.** Make sure you are assigning the FXActor that is physically placed in the map instead of the abstract concept of an FXActor. It should always start with `FXActor_TA'yourMapName`.
:::

## Custom Boost Pill

If you wish to create boost with custom functionality, perhaps with a different respawn time or boost amount, these values may be easily changed within the properties of each `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA`. For **truly custom boost** with a different appearance or hitbox, we must go deeper.

![](/images/udk/advanced/boost_custom.png "Booooooooooooooooooooost")

**First, find `FXActor_Boost_TA` in the Actors tab of the Content Browser. Drag it onto the map. Next, find `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` and drag it onto the map. Last, add the Static Mesh named `BoostPad_Large` from the Park_P package.** Or add your own custom mesh. You're unstoppable. **However, note that this requires the FXActorEvents.upk dummy assets package, which was added to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapmaking/RL_DummyAssets) in 2021.**

**Pick the same X and Y location for all of these objects. Set the locations of the `FXActor_Boost_TA` and the Static Mesh to 0 in Z. Set the Z location of the `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` to 72.**

![](/images/udk/advanced/boost_custompillattachments.png "Don't get too attached")

Inside the properties of the `FXActor_Boost_TA`, **add 3 Attachment slots.** You may simply copy text from these tables, but please feel free to try substituting any of the Particle Systems or Static Meshes for a different one from the dummy assets.

### Slot 0

Slot 0 will be the hovering ball of gooey boost, which is implemented as a particle system.

| Detach Any                | Add a new item     | FXActorEvent_X'FXActorEvents.PickedUp' |

When adding the ParticleSystemComponent, **press P to quickly jump between items starting with P.** Try out `ParticleSystem'Boost_AlphaReward_SF.boost_alphareward.fx.Drive_PS'` instead of the standard BoostOrb_PS (and set the Primitive Component's Pitch to -90 and Scale to 5).

### Slot 1

Slot 1 will be the glow emanating from the base of the pickup, which is implemented as a mesh.

| Rendering                 | Add a second slot    | Material'Park_P.pickup_boost.BoostPad_LightCone_03_Mat' |
| Attach Any                | Add a new item       | FXActorEvent_X'FXActorEvents.Spawned' |
| Detach Any                | Add a new item       | FXActorEvent_X'FXActorEvents.PickedUp' |

Try replacing the BoostPad_Large_Glow mesh with your own model. The UV map for the LightCone material is exactly what you'd expect.

### Slot 2

Slot 2 will be the effect that plays when the boost is picked up, which is implemented as a particle system.

| Attach Any                | Add a new item       | FXActorEvent_X'FXActorEvents.PickedUp’ |

Note that the Attach Any triggers on **PickedUp,** which is the opposite of the other two attachments. That is because this plays only when the pickup happens.

**Lastly, the FXActor needs one crucial change, otherwise it will never reappear visually:**

### VehiclePickup_Boost_TA Properties

Next, there are some properties to set within the boost pill’s `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA`:

![](/images/udk/advanced/boost_custompill_pickup.png "A little pick-me-up")

| Search for | Change the line(s) | To this value  |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| “loca”     | Z                  | 72             |
| “boo”      | Boost Amount       | 9999           |
| “boo”      | Boost Type         | BoostType_Pill |
| “res”      | Respawn Delay      | 10             |

**Lastly, lock the properties window. Select the `FXActor_Boost_TA`, then hit the green arrow.** ![Use selected icon](/images/udk/advanced/icon_use_boost.png)! This tells the VehiclePickup which FXActor it should animate (and then hide) when a player passes through its hitbox. And speaking of the hitbox, it may be changed in the Collision section of the Properties window.

**Try creating Evil Boost with a negative Boost Amount.** Fufufufu.

## Custom Boost Pad

To create a boost pad, we will follow most of the same steps. This time, however, there are only two Attachments.

### Slot 0

Slot 0 will be the glow emanating from the base of the pickup, which is implemented as a mesh.

| ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Name                      | Type a name          | BaseMesh   |
| Component                 | Click blue arrow     | StaticMeshComponent |
| Particle System Component | Assign a Static Mesh | StaticMesh'Park_P.pickup_boost.BoostPad_Small_02_SM' |
| Rendering                 | Add a Material slot  | Material'Park_P.pickup_boost.BoostPad_LightCone_03_Mat' |
| Rendering                 | Add a second slot    | Material'Park_P.pickup_boost.Materials.BoostOrb_Glow_Mat' |
| Attach Any                | Add a new item       | FXActorEvent_X'FXActorEvents.Spawned' |
| Detach Any                | Add a new item       | FXActorEvent_X'FXActorEvents.PickedUp' |

Note that the order of the materials is swapped from the boost pills. Thanks Psyonix.

### Slot 1

Slot 1 will be the effect that plays when the boost is picked up, which is implemented as a particle system.

### VehiclePickup_Boost_TA Properties

**Set these values for the boost pad’s VehiclePickup_Boost_TA:**

| Search for | Change the line(s) | To this value |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| “loca”     | Z                  | 60            |
| “boo”      | Boost Amount       | 0.120         |
| “boo”      | Boost Type         | BoostType_Pad |
| “res”      | Respawn Delay      | 4             |

**Remember to assign the `FXActor_Boost_TA` to the FXActor slot as well.**
