# What Next?

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You have made a fully functional and multiplayer-capable Rocket League map from scratch. However, this is really just the beginning of the journey. You are going to want to mess with the walls, spawn extra balls, create parkour courses, or invent a new game mode entirely. In fact, you probably had those ideas to begin with, and then I dragged you through something you didn’t really even want to make. I hope some of it was useful.

This is probably a good time to revisit the flowchart at the start of this guide: [The Big Picture](../../essential/01_flowchart.html)

In general, you are going to need to either [learn how to use Blender](../blender/01_blender.html) (or a different program if you have access to it) or convince someone to make 3D models for you. You are also going to need some basic image editing skills, unless you plan to rely entirely on in-game materials. And, you are going to need to have patience fumbling around in [Kismet](../kismet/01_kismet.html). There are a few programming ideas that are helpful to understand how to achieve your idea, but very little prior knowledge is needed.

And as always, don’t be afraid to ask for help. We’re all in this together.
