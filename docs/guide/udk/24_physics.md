## Advanced Gravity

DoktorBotti has created an awesome tool for making complex gravity situations with [a tutorial](https://youtu.be/U35d40LHH14) on how to make your own gravity fields. If you want to know how it works, you can take a look at [the source code](https://github.com/DoktorBotti/RL_LocalGravityAssistant). If you have any questions about it, he will probably be glad to help you and if you have created a map using the tool, dont forget to ping him ;)
