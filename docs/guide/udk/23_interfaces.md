# UDK Advanced

## Getting started <Badge text="not finished" type="warning"/>

Before starting with making your own interfaces UDK needs some more configuration. Check if you have the folder `{UDK Folder}/UDKGame/Flash/` and if not create the `Flash` folder. In the `Flash` folder create another folder with the name of your map and copy this [example interface]() into the folder. The location of the interface would then be `{UDK Folder}/UDKGame/Flash/{map name}/template.swf`.
