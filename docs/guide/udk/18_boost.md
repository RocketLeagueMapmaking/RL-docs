# UDK Basics

## List of Terms

What a sad place the world would be without boost. Luckily, it can be added and thoroughly customized. As is tradition, I will start with a list of terms:

* Boost Pad - A glowing pad on the ground that gives you a little bit of boost
* Boost Pill - A hovering orb that gives you full boost (corner/mid boosts)
* VehiclePickup_Boost_TA - An actor which controls the logic of the boost pickup
* FXActor_Boost_TA - An actor which gives the visual appearance of the boost pickup
* StaticMeshActor - The solid object underneath the orange glow

## Boost Pill

The image shown above is a `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` on top of an `FXActor_Boost_TA` and a StaticMeshActor. This one is a Boost Pill, as you can tell from the long legs on the model.

**First, find `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` in the Actors tab of the Content Browser. Drag it onto the map. Next, find `FXActor_Boost_TA` and drag it onto the map. Last, add the Static Mesh named `BoostPad_Large` from the Park_P package.**

**Pick the same X and Y location for all of these objects. Set the locations of the `FXActor_Boost_TA` and the Static Mesh to 0 in Z. Set the Z location of the `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` to 72.**

### Edit properties

Next, there are some properties to set within the boost pill’s VehiclePickup_Boost_TA:

|Search for|Change the line(s)|To this value|
|------|------|------|
|“loca”| Z | 72 |
|“boo” |Boost Amount| 9999|
|“boo” | Boost Type| BoostType_Pill|
|“res” |Respawn Delay|10|

**Lastly, lock the properties window. Select the `FXActor_Boost_TA`, then hit the arrow.** This tells the VehiclePickup which boost it should animate (and then hide) when a player passes through its hitbox. And speaking of the hitbox, its radius is given by the Boost Type selection.

**The `FXActor` needs one crucial change:**
|Search for|Change the line(s)|To this value|
|------|------|------|
|“del”|No Delete|Checked|

To create a boost pad, follow the same steps. However, you will notice that there is no mesh called “Boostpad_Small.” Psyonix instead chose to use objects which are groupings of several small boost pads. **For now, just add the VehiclePickup_Boost_TA and the FXActor_Boost_TA**. Note that it is also lower than the pill pickup.


**Set these values for the boost pad’s VehiclePickup_Boost_TA:**

|Search for|Change the line(s)|To this value|
|“loca”|Z|63|
|“boo”|Boost Amount|0.119|
|“boo”|Boost Type|BoostType_Pad|
|“res”|Respawn Delay|4|

**Remember to assign the `FXActor_Boost_TA` to the `FXActor` slot as well.**


Luckily, boost pickups behave better when mirroring than spawnpoints do. To create the other boost pills, **select the stack of objects, copy and paste them, then edit their X and Y locations at the same time in the Properties window. Alternatively, copy and paste these objects, right click, and select Transform > Mirror X/Y Axis.**


Boost pickups on a standard Soccar map are at these locations. The ± symbol means that there is a pad at both +X and -X, or +Y and -Y, so placing the pickups listed below and mirroring them will make a complete set:

|Pickup Type|X|Y|
|------|------|------|
|Pill|±3072|±4096|
|Pill|±3584|0|
|Pad|±1792|±4184|
|Pad|±940|±3308|
|Pad|±1788|±2300|
|Pad|±2048|±1036|
|Pad|±3584|±2484|
|Pad|0|±4240|
|Pad|0|±2816|
|Pad|0|±1024|
|Pad|±1024|0|

**Whenever you copy and paste a set of boost objects, the new `VehiclePickup_Boost_TA` will not have the FXActor assigned automatically. You must go in and manually reassociate them.** It's easiest to do this in the Scene tab of the Content Browser, which will do a better job of preserving your selection as you go along.

You may have noticed that the boost pads still have no static mesh under them. We can solve this in several ways: **Make our own in Blender, rip one out of the game, or use a library of Dummy Assets to borrow things from Rocket League itself.** All are absolutely worth learning about.
