# Hello Guide

The UDK Basics guide was originally written as a Google doc, with the intention being for the reader to follow all of the sections in order. That approach is absolutely the best way to enjoy it.

If you're reading this, hopefully you have completed all of the steps in the [Essentials section](../../essential/):

* Installed UDK 2015
* Added Dummy Classes to UDK install
* Installed 3D modeling software, like Blender
* Installed image editing software, like Paint.net
* Created a StickyWalls Physical Material

If so, you're ready to go. Recall this [flowchart](../../essential/flowchart.md) from the Essentials guide. This will help you focus your energy.

**By the time you reach the end of this section, you will have made a fully functional custom map that can be played with friends.** If you skip too much, you might be left wondering why you fall through the floor, or why the shadows in your map are so harsh, or why your game crashes every time you load your map.

You'll likely require assistance at some point in your journey. Please check the [FAQ](../../faq/) or [contact us](../../more/contact) for assistance. Join the [Rocket League Mapmaking Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PWu3ZWa) to get connected.
