# Hello Guide

The UDK Basics guide was originally written as a Google doc, with the intention being for the reader to follow all of the sections in order. That approach is absolutely the best way to enjoy it.

**By the time you reach the end of this section, you will have made a fully functional custom map that can be played with friends.** If you skip too much, you might be left wondering why the shadows in your map are so harsh, for example.
