## Hoops

The gamemode hoops has a few special changes to the normal soccar mode: the field is a bit smaller and the goal nets are replaced by hoops rims. [Mr Swaggles]() and [KegBob]() have made some amazing hoops maps which you can use as a template or inspiration for your own hoops map. You can always go the [Ranked hoops](https://discord.rankedhoops.gg) discord server if you want to exchange some ideas or get feedback.

Another special thing about hoops is the floor. [HoopsFloor_Clean](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IgdR1_6jnBHw3ZB34DKHr6FUKlamkl2r/view?usp=sharing) is a fine-tuned version of the hoops floor, with the lines physically extruded. Because of that, you need to use a flat surface like [HoopsFloor_Coll](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bCouWyxO8i17fiyH97S-yB1iFHJW8Fgy/view?usp=sharing) (put the [StickyWalls physics material]() and check `Hidden game` for this mesh) for the collision geometry.
