# Decryption

## Music

If you've ever opened CookedPCConsole and sorted by alphabetical, you've seen a long list of files named with seemingly random numbers. Those are all of the songs that play on the main menu!

[Here is a nice tool to decrypt them](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kOP6-7ZD-zbXeI6Bj38jjJ9-YVO-hzN4/view?usp=sharing). ItsBrank has explained [how to get the sound files](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o-7AojY1j4_5i0gj5LmI6hDhJL9VZg0IW40KL7objQ/edit#heading=h.f2cgs67ceuuy) in his mini-modding guide. The resulting `.ogg` files may be played with a media player such as VLC. Keep in mind that these are not DMCA-free.
