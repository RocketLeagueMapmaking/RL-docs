# Decryption

Decrypting assets from the game is great for discovering new techniques or cleaning up old data, but please remember these words from earlier in the guide:

> **Rocket League mapmaking techniques cannot be used to give you a competitive advantage in the game, and any attempts at that are directly against the [EULA](../../more/psyonix).** Please play nice and play by the rules, and you have nothing to fear.

uMod is outdated and it doesn't work anymore since the DX11 update. It was used for extracting textures and applying them in-game. You can use the Alphaconsole plugin for bakkesmod and uModel now to replace uMod.

ItsBrank has created [a mini-modding guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o-7AojY1j4_5i0gj5LmI6hDhJL9VZg0IW40KL7objQ/edit#heading=h.v08ltc525arh) which includes converting Rocket League sounds and exporting UPK files.

## Getting started

To get started with decrypting the assets, you will need some tools. Each tool has a different focus to extract a certain type of asset. They can be installed in the Map making or in the Rocket League mods discord server with the RLAESKeyBot bot. 

* uModel (or UE Viewer): used for [decrypting and exporting assets](01_assets)
* UE Explorer: used for [decrypting classes](02_classes)

:::warning uModel win32
There are 2 versions of uModel, one from the RLAESKeyBot bot and [the win32 version](). If you can't open something try it again with the other version
