# Kismet nodes reference

This is an attempt on a public kismet reference for nodes specifically in Rocket League.
After a notable update in the game for kismet, this list will be updated (hopefully);
the latest version for this reference is visible [in the badge in this guide](player.md) or the latest commit in the [Dummy Classes][dc2].

:::details How to use

- This reference does not contain descriptions on each node (yet), to add them contribute to the [Dummy Classes][dc2]
- The following query parameters are supported:
  - `search=lower_case_node`. If this parameter is used, the other parameters will be ignored.
  - `type={actions,events,conditions,all}`
  - `upk={all,ProjectX,TAGame}`
