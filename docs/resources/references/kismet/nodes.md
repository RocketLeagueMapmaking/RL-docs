# Kismet nodes reference

This is an attempt on a public kismet reference for nodes specifically in Rocket League.
After a notable update in the game for kismet, this list will be updated (hopefully);
the latest version for this reference is visible [in the badge in this guide](class.md) or the latest commit in the [Dummy Classes][dc2].
