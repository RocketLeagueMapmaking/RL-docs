## Getting Started

**This is not going to be easy, but it will be rewarding if you see it through.**
**I believe in you.**

Naming portions of this website is tricky since, truly, most of the content is essential to creating a fun map. However, this portion contains all of the UDK setup information, which is the only thing that is truly required to create maps.

## Epic Games

The process for making a custom map is almost the same for Epic Games as Steam. For example, the file paths for installing and using tools are different. Another difference is the process of [publishing a map](../multiplayer/02_publishing).
