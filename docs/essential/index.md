# Mapmaking Essentials

![Introduction image](/images/udk/essential/dangerous.png "It is also dangerous to take this")

## Getting Started

**This is not going to be easy, but it will be rewarding if you see it through.**
**I believe in you.**

Naming portions of this website is tricky since, truly, most of the content is essential to creating a fun map. However, this portion contains all of the UDK setup information, which is the only thing that is truly required to create maps.

:::tip Important

## Epic Games

**Custom maps can be made with the Epic Games Launcher version of Rocket League,** with only slight differences. For example, the file paths for various tools may change. The process of [publishing a map](../guide/multiplayer/publishing.md) is the only notable difference.

## Feedback
