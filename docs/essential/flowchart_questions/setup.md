### Do you have UDK installed?

UDK, or the Unreal Development Kit, is the program used to create games in Unreal Engine 3. Since Rocket League is made with this tool, we have to use it too.

If you are new to UDK, I recommend that you follow most of this website in order.

To install UDK you may use the Easy Installer,
or do it yourself.

Either way, please follow the Installing UDK tutorial sections.

### Do you want to make 3D objects?

Rocket League maps are made of 3D assets called meshes.
You will have to get used to manipulating them in UDK, but you don't necessarily need to make them yourself.

UDK has a built-in tool called CSG that some find useful. However, it has severe limitations and will result in boxy, simple-looking maps.

For more detail, websites such as Sketchfab or cgtrader offer some free 3D models. The quality and versatility of free assets is wildly inconsistent, so your mileage may vary. Alternatively, you might find some people in the community willing to make 3D models for you.

But most importantly, please do not beg for or expect free 3D models. Some people go to university specifically to learn these skills, and it's hard work.

This website has extensive tutorials to help you learn how to make your own, which is my recommendation.
